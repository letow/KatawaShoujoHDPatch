## Description
Katawa Shoujo is a visual novel by Four Leaf Studios that tells the story of a young man and five young women living with varying disabilities. 

The game has been in development from 2007, and it was released in January 4, 2012. It was quite a long time ago, wasn’t it?  
The official game is available only in resolution 800x600. It’s actually not that good for *visual* novel in ~~2020~~ 2021.

Remastered Katawa Shoujo is the same (g)old story but in a new HD shell.

__Enjoy a good story in a good quality!__

## Comparison

Screenshots below are presented in their original size - 1920x1080 (remastered) and 800x600 (original).

And for example, that's how Lilly's sprite appears in fullscreen mode.

This wideness of an original image happens because of stretching window from 4:3 to 16:9. In HD version it looks better and naturally.

## Download

The game can be downloaded from section ["Releases"](https://github.com/letow/KatawaShoujoHD/releases) on the right.  
(By the way, original novel was downloaded [here](https://www.katawa-shoujo.com/)).

## History

As I said above, the official game is available only in quite low resolution, so I’ve decided to make a remastered version of Katawa Shoujo for modern FullHD displays.

I was kind of surprised seeing that no one have tried to make this happen before me. But maybe I just was looking badly.  
Anyway, the only thing I’ve found was [the post by Valjean_Lafitte](https://www.reddit.com/r/katawashoujo/comments/hsqwwf/katawa_shoujo_in_hd_proof_of_concept/) on [Katawa Shoujo’s subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/katawashoujo/). He just showed the "Katawa Shoujo in HD" concept with upscaled sprites and backgrounds. I realized that it doesn’t seem so difficult and I should give it a try.

It took about one month of almost every evening of upscaling, adjusting, image editing, etc. So here it is.
